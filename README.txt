PRIZE FIGHTER

CONTROLS:
•WASD/Arrow Keys - Movement
•Mouse - Camera Controls (Levels only)

HOW TO PLAY:
•Players enter levels from the hub world, pressing Q inside the portal to begin.
•Levels contain tokens used to progress to new levels, as well as stickers to unlock things in the Gallery Mode.
•Players must clear levels by making it to the end, and the tokens they gather will unlock new levels.

AREAS FOR FEEDBACK:
•Level difficulty
•Grapple implementation
•Wall Jump implementation
•Coyote Time implementation (fix to the Double Jump issues from last test)
•Enemy behaviors

RELEASE NOTES (Pre-Vertical Slice): 
•All assets implemented (only proxy left is the player)
•Basic UI Design
•Double Jump, Wall Jump and Grapple refined for build based on prototype feedback
•Sloped surfaces and camera sensitivity adjusted

KNOWN BUGS:
•Enemy behavior still in development- knockback force applied is too drastic and bounce does not yet function
