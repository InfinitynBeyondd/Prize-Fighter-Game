  - Hey there pup, I saw your little look-see with Minako.
  - "She\u2019s been stuck in there for FOREVER. The Claw's never let her be won!"
  - '...What was that? You wanna get her OUT!? '
  - Sorry, but there's no way you're beating The Claw. He's been the top dog around
    here for ages.
  - "...You're really serious about this, huh? Well, If you wanna get her out, you\u2019re
    gonna have to learn the basics first!"
  - Luckily for you, good ol' iDog's got you covered!
  - I'll be sending you over to my state-of-the art training system to get you started!
