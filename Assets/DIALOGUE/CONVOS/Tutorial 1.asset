  - You've got some serious hops! But it looks like this wall is blocking your way!
  - When you need to make it up a surface, press [A or Space] repeatedly while clinging
    onto the surface to VAULT up the wall!
  - VAULTS can come in super handy when you barely miss a jump, or when you just
    need to scale a wall!
