  - "Let\u2019s get started! If you want to stand a chance against CLAW, you're gonna
    have to show me you got what it takes!"
  - Press [A or Space] to JUMP, then tap it again while airborne for a  DOUBLE JUMP.
    You can also VAULT by JUMPing against a wall!
  - Face a blue wall and press [RT or M2] to GRAPPLE. Getting a running start and
    jumping before grappling can come in handy too!
  - Combine a JUMP and a PUNCH [M1 or B] to DIVE PUNCH a button!
  - For a normal PUNCH, just press [M1 or B] while grounded!
  - That's [A or Space] to JUMP/VAULT (Against Wall),   [RT or M2] to GRAPPLE,  
    [M1 or B] to PUNCH/DIVE PUNCH (Airborne)!
